&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thesis Title:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; A Fractal Analysis of Umbrae, Penumbrae and Magnetograms within Active Regions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; The scale free fractal dimensions were determined for the umbral and penumbral regions as well as the underlying magnetic field regions of 16 active regions observed between June-November 2015. Hi-resolution white light images were obtained from the University College of the Cayman Islands (UCCI) Observatory on the Grand Cayman while magnetograms were obtained from the Joint Science Operations Centre (JSOC). The area-perimeter method was used, and the fractal dimensions of umbral and penumbral regions were found to be 2.09 ± 0.42 and 1.72 ± 0.4 respectively with strong and weak magnetic field groups having fractal dimensions of 1.79 ± 0.49 and 1.96 ± 0.29 respectively. Using the fractal dimensions as an indicator for complexity, it was observed that complex, weak magnetic fields produce less complex penumbral regions while less complex, strong magnetic fields produce more complex umbral regions. This observation supports the recent model of sunspot formation where strong magnetic fields are trapped within the umbra reducing their freedom of motion indicated by the lower fractal dimension while unbound, weak magnetic fields found in penumbral regions are indicated by higher fractal dimensions. However, the reduced temperature caused by trapping of the strong magnetic fields in the umbral regions lead to more complex umbral structures while higher temperatures in penumbral regions form less complex penumbral structures as indicated by the respective fractal dimensions. An initial temporal analysis of the umbral and penumbral structures’ reveals a correlation which indicates that the changes in complexity between regions may be linked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>A Fractal Analysis of Magnetograms Within Active Regions</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Rajkumar, Brandon, and Shirin Haque. 2020. &amp;quot;A Fractal Analysis of Magnetograms Within Active Regions.&amp;quot; Solar Physics 295 (2): 1-12. doi: 10.1007&#x2F;s11207-017-1184-2.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract -&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; The magnetograms of sixteen Active Regions, observed during June - November 2015, were obtained from the Joint Science Operations Center and used to determine the fractal dimensions of various magnetic field groups. The fields were divided into strong (positive and negative) and weak (positive and negative) groupings. The area-perimeter method was used to determine the fractal dimensions for the umbral and penumbral regions of the magnetograms. The fractal dimensions were found to be 1.79 ± 0.49 and 1.96 ± 0.29 for strong and weak magnetic fields respectively. When compared to the umbral and penumbral fractal dimensions determined by (Rajkumar, Haque and Hrudey, 2017) using white light images, an inverse relationship was found, with the umbra showing lower fractal dimensions than the penumbra for the magnetic field groups compared to the intensity images. This directly implies that there is greater complexity in the penumbral magnetic field groupings than the umbral region. This has implications for models that constrain how the magnetic field groups are contained in the cooler umbral regions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract -&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; The images of sunspots in sixteen active regions taken at the UCCI Observatory in Grand Cayman during June - November 2015, were used to determine their fractal dimensions using the perimeter-area method for the umbral and the penumbral region. Scale free fractal dimensions of 2.09 ± 0.42 and 1.72 ± 0.4 were found respectively. This value was higher than the value determined by Chumak and Chumak (1996) who used a similar method but for the penumbral region only for their sample set. There is a positive correlation r = 0.58 between umbral and the penumbral fractal dimensions for the specific sunspots. Furthermore, a time series analysis was done similarly on eight images of AR 12403, from 21st August 2015 - 28th August 2015 taken from the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD). The correlation, r = 0.623 between the umbral and penumbral fractal dimensions in the time series indicating that the complexity in morphology indicated by the fractal dimension between the umbra and penumbra followed each other in time as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thesis Title:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Observational Astronomy: The Re-Installation of the Meade 16&amp;quot; LX200&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; With the growth of Astronomy in the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago and the University of the West Indies, it is clear that the availability of observational research at the Department of Physics, would be a valuable asset to the UWI, St. Augustine. As such, the re-installation of the Meade 16&amp;quot; LX200 at the SATU Observatory for the purpose of scientific research and teaching was commissioned. To determine the most suitable research area for the LX200, tests to determine the systems limits were completed. The image scale was determined to be 20.82 by 20.82 arc minutes. It was also noted that, while the center of the image frame appeared free of aberrations, the degree of coma increased toward the edges. A field curvature of 24.9% and a tilt of 49% at a 59 degree angle were also discovered. These limits revealed that the LX200 would be best suited for collecting photometric data. It was suggested that the telescope be upgraded to perform wide field photometric surveys by replacing the OTA and installing a corrector lens to remove aberrations as well as replacing the CCD with a new SBIG STX-16803 CCD which would increase the image scale to 42 by 42 arc minutes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
